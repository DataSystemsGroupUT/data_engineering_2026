## 🚀 Introduction to Apache Airflow

[![Apache Airflow Logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/AirflowLogo.png)](https://airflow.apache.org)

**Apache Airflow** is an open-source platform designed to **author, schedule, and monitor data pipelines**.  
Workflows are defined as **Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)** written in Python, giving engineers full control and flexibility over task orchestration.

### ✨ Core Features
- **Python-based DAGs:** Define complex workflows programmatically with dependencies and conditions.
- **Dynamic Scheduling:** Trigger workflows at fixed intervals, based on events, or manually.
- **Rich UI & Monitoring:** Visualize DAG runs, dependencies, and task logs in real time.
- **XComs & Task Communication:** Share small data between tasks.
- **Retry & SLA Management:** Robust handling of task failures and performance alerts.
- **Plugins & Extensibility:** Integrate with AWS, GCP, Databricks, Spark, or any custom operator.
- **Task Sensors:** Wait for events (like file creation, API responses, or DB updates) before triggering downstream tasks.

---
### Architecture 
Apache Airflow follows a **modular architecture** with components that work together to schedule, execute, and monitor workflows (DAGs).

#### 🧱 Core Components

- **Webserver (UI)**  
  A Flask-based web app that lets users view DAGs, trigger runs, monitor task status, and inspect logs.

- **Scheduler**  
  The brain of Airflow — it parses DAG definitions, schedules tasks, and sends them to the executor when their dependencies are met.

- **Executor**  
  Determines *how and where* tasks run.  
  Examples:  
  - `SequentialExecutor` (local, for testing)  
  - `LocalExecutor` (parallel on one machine)  
  - `CeleryExecutor` or `KubernetesExecutor` (distributed scale-out)

- **Metadata Database**  
  Stores DAG definitions, task states, connections, and logs.  
  Typically runs on **Postgres** or **MySQL**.

- **Worker(s)**  
  Execute tasks as directed by the scheduler (only used in distributed executors like Celery/Kubernetes).

- **Triggerer (for deferrable tasks)**  
  Efficiently manages long waits (like sensors or async events) without blocking workers.

- **DAGs Folder**  
  Directory where Airflow scans for Python scripts defining DAGs.

#### 🔄 How It Works (High-Level Flow)

1. **DAG parsing** – The scheduler scans the DAG folder and loads all defined workflows into the metadata DB.  
2. **Task scheduling** – Based on schedules or triggers, tasks are queued for execution.  
3. **Execution** – The executor assigns tasks to workers (local or distributed).  
4. **Tracking** – Task states and logs are stored in the metadata DB and shown in the web UI.

## Advanced Capabilities

- **Dynamic DAG Generation:** DAGs can be generated dynamically at runtime using Python & Yaml templating
- **Task Groups & Dependencies:** Simplify DAG readability and structure.
- **REST API:** Allows external services or CI/CD pipelines to trigger and monitor workflows programmatically.
- **Secrets Backend Integration:** Securely manage credentials via AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, etc.
- **Airflow Smart Sensors:** Efficiently handle thousands of waiting sensors without overloading the scheduler.

## Disadvantages and Industry Trade-offs

Despite its popularity, **Airflow isn’t always the right tool** for every orchestration need:

### Disadvantages
- **Operational Overhead:** Requires maintaining a scheduler, metadata DB, and workers — not ideal for small workloads.
- **Scaling Challenges:** The Celery/Kubernetes executors require additional configuration to scale reliably.
- **Latency:** Airflow is **not real-time** — designed for batch or scheduled pipelines, not streaming.
- **Complex Debugging:** Failures in dynamic DAGs or multi-dependency tasks can be difficult to trace.
- **Version Drift:** Upgrading across Airflow versions can break DAG compatibility.
- **Limited Local Development Experience:** DAG testing locally can be slow due to scheduler reliance.

### 💡 When Airflow Might *Not* Be Ideal
- For **low-latency or event-driven** data pipelines → use **Prefect**, **Dagster**, or **dbt Cloud**.
- For **microservice orchestration** → tools like **Temporal**, **AWS Step Functions**, or **Argo Workflows** may fit better.

## Practice Assignment: BTC Price Analyzer

This hands-on assignment demonstrates a real-world use case:
tracking Bitcoin prices, calculating a rolling average, and triggering buy/sell orders based on market conditions.

### 📈 DAG: `price_trend_analyzer`
1. Fetches BTC price periodically (e.g., every minute) from CoinGecko API (no authentication required).
2. Stores it in a dedicated Postgres database (`prices-db`) in `btc_prices` table.
3. Computes 15-minute rolling average and stores in `rolling_averages`.
4. Makes a decision:
   - **BUY** if the price drops below the rolling average.
   - **SELL** if the price exceeds the rolling average.
5. Logs all results and decisions into the `orders` table.

---

## SQL Schema Setup

You can initialize your `prices-db` with:

```sql
-- Database: prices-db
-- Replace with: CREATE DATABASE prices-db; if needed

-- Table to store raw BTC prices
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS btc_prices (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ts TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    price NUMERIC(18,8) NOT NULL
);

-- Table to store rolling averages
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS btc_rolling_avg (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ts TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    rolling_avg NUMERIC(18,8) NOT NULL
);

-- Table to log triggered orders
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders_log (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
    payload JSONB,
    response JSONB,
    status VARCHAR(32)
);

```

## DAG — Price Trend Analyzer

The DAG (`price_trend_analyzer.py`) is located in the `solution/` folder.
When setting up Airflow, you need to copy this file into the Airflow DAGs directory:

```cp solution/price_trend_analyzer.py airflow/dags/```

### DAG Overview

This DAG simulates the process of tracking Bitcoin (BTC) price movements, calculating rolling averages, and generating buy/sell signals.

It performs the following key tasks:

- Fetch Latest BTC Price
- Retrieves (or simulates) the latest BTC price at each scheduled interval.

Store Price in Database
Inserts the current timestamp and price into the btc_prices table.

Compute Rolling Average
Calculates a rolling average over the last 15 minutes and stores it in btc_rolling_avg.

Analyze Price Trends
Compares recent prices to detect upward or downward trends relative to the rolling average.

Trigger Buy/Sell Orders
If a signal is detected:

A Buy order is generated when prices rise above the rolling average after being below it.

A Sell order is generated when prices drop below the rolling average after being above it.

Log Orders
Each triggered order is:

Written as a JSON file under /tmp/data/orders/

Logged into the orders_log table for auditability.

### DAG Schedule

The DAG runs every minute (`*/1 * * * *`), simulating continuous BTC market monitoring and analysis.
It fetches simulated price data, calculates a 15-minute rolling average, and logs potential Buy or Sell triggers.

Airflow automatically manages backfilling, meaning if the DAG was paused or Airflow was down, it can retroactively execute any missed runs to ensure data continuity.
This is especially useful in production pipelines where historical data consistency matters.

The DAG file is provided in the `solution/` folder.
Once Airflow is running, copy it into the `airflow/dags/` directory. First time it does not automatically detect the dag, you need to run airflow init. 

```airflow db migrate```
Or click run for airflow-init service in the running container from Docker Desktop 


### Extension of Assignment — Order Trigger

This part builds on the **Price Trend Analyzer** DAG and introduces event-driven orchestration using Airflow sensors.  

Once the first DAG generates an order JSON file (in `/tmp/data/orders`), this second DAG should automatically detect it and trigger a follow-up workflow to **push the order to an external API**.  

#### Requirements

1. **File Sensor**  
   - Use an Airflow `FileSensor` to continuously monitor the directory for new JSON files created by the `price_trend_analyzer` DAG.  
   - When a new file is detected, the DAG should start execution automatically.

2. **Push to Order API**  
   - Read the JSON payload and send it to the provided **Order API** endpoint.  
   - API credentials and access details are available in the forum.

3. **Error Handling & Retry Logic**  
   - Occasionally, the API may return a `503 Service Unavailable` error.  
   - In such cases, wait **5 seconds** before retrying.  
   - Retry up to **3 times** before marking the request as failed.

4. **Database Logging**  
   - All requests and responses (successful or failed) must be logged into the `orders_log` table in the `prices-db`.  
   - Log fields should include:  
     - `payload` (JSON content sent)  
     - `status` (e.g., *success*, *failed*)  
     - `response` (API response body or error message)

This part requires use of Airflow sensor. 

### 🛰️ Airflow Sensors — Waiting for External Events

**Sensors** in Apache Airflow are *special operators* that **wait for a condition to be true** before allowing downstream tasks to continue.

They are useful when your pipeline depends on **external events or data availability** — for example:
- Waiting for a file to appear in a folder (e.g., on S3 or local filesystem)
- Waiting for a table or partition to be ready in a database
- Waiting for another DAG or task to finish

#### 🧩 How Sensors Work

A sensor is just like any other operator but runs in a *loop*, periodically checking a condition.

```python
from airflow.sensors.filesystem import FileSensor

wait_for_file = FileSensor(
    task_id="wait_for_btc_order_file",
    fs_conn_id="fs_default",
    filepath="/tmp/data/orders/order.json",
    poke_interval=30,  # check every 30 seconds
    timeout=600,       # give up after 10 minutes
)
```

#### 🧩🧩 Resource efficiency

Default mode ("poke"): blocks the worker slot while waiting.

Recommended: mode="reschedule": releases the slot between checks → frees resources.

Example:
```python
wait_for_btc_order_file = FileSensor(
    task_id="wait_for_btc_order_file",
    filepath="/tmp/data/orders/order.json",
    mode="reschedule",
    poke_interval=30,
    timeout=600
)
```

#### 🧠 Goal

This exercise demonstrates **event-driven DAG triggering**, **sensor-based workflows**, and **robust API interaction with retry logic** — key concepts in production-grade data pipelines.


### Discussion Pointers
